Offline Messenger is a concurrent client/server application that allows multiple users to connect simultaneously. It enables the sending of messages to other registered users, regardless of whether the message recipient is currently connected to the server or not.

This application allows viewing conversation history and the possibility of replaying a selected message. In case a user is not connected to the server and receives a message, they have the ability to view the received message.

To send a message, the user must be logged in, and the message sending process is handled by the server.
