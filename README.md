Offline messenger is a concurrent client/server application that allows multiple users to connect simultaneously. It allows sending messages to other registered users, regardless of whether or not the receiver of the message is connected to the server at that moment.

This application allows viewing the history of conversions and the possibility of replaying a selected message. If a user is not connected to the server and receives a message, he has the possibility to view the received message.

To send a message, the user must be logged in, the message being sent by the server.
